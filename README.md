Sencha demo to show how to create a Model View Controller application:

  * a model with fields
  * a view to list items and a view to edit items
  * a controller

To display the MVC application we also use:

  * a data store of model instances
  * a grid to show rows of instances
  * a viewport to display the grid

This demo is based on the Sencha tutorials and documentation.
